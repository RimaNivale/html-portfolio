<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone!ðŸ‘‹ 
  I'm Rima Nathuram Nivale, currently in my third year pursuing a B.E. in Computer Engineering at G.M. Vedak Institute of Technology,
  affiliated with Mumbai University. Currently delving into the exciting realm of Web Development, I'm passionately working on a freelance 
  project crafting an e-commerce website for a snacks store, where I blend my skills to craft innovative solutions. Beyond the confines of academia,
  I thrive on challenges, turning ideas into tangible outcomes. My journey isn't just about code; it's also about giving back. Volunteering at Swades 
  Foundation is where I find fulfillment, making a positive impact on communities.</p>

<p>Let's connect and delve into the fascinating intersections of technology, innovation, and community service. </p>

<p> I'm open to new opportunities, collaborations, and insightful conversations!</p>
